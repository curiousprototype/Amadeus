1. get the fifth line from the end of file 'result.txt'.
   And then take the 2nd content of this line, output to file 'collect.txt'

command:
>>> tac result.txt | sed -n 5p | awk '{print$2}' >> collect.txt

Detail:
   'tac result.txt' means reverse the line of result.txt and output to the screen
   'sed -n 5p' means get the 5th line, we use '|', so it get 5th line from 'tac result.txt' which means the 5th line from the end of result.txt
   'awk '{print$2}'' means print the 2nd content of each line, divided by spaces.

2. do decimal multiple in shell script

command:
>>> echo "num1 * num2" |bc

Example:
>>> lo_THz=$(tac result.txt | sed -n 5p | awk '{print$2}')
>>> lo_cm=$(echo "$lo_THz * 33.35641" |bc)

3. loop all files and directories under path.

command:
>>> for file in `ls $l`; do
>>>        echo "$file"
>>> done

Attention:
  this loop will loop over all file and directories. If you only want directories or files, you need to write a 'if' judgement.
See below:

>>> if [ -d $folder ]; then
            echo $folder
>>> fi

This 'if' command will output all DIRECTORIES.
