scripts for **FHI-aims**.

Based on tutorials 2,3 and 6 at: https://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/meetings/DFT-workshop-2019/index.php?n=Meeting.Program

Some scripts they provide are out-of-date, I modified them.

1. aimsplot_update.py:  use for ploting band structure and dos.

dir  vibes_script:  scripts for FHI-vibes

2. subtract_cubes.py:  check the change in electron density upon charging(positive or negative)

see dir: /home/quan/Desktop/researchs/learn_fhi_aims/tutorial_2/my_homework/exercise_9/relax

see also the tutorial2 section: exercise_9

3. set_VBM_to_zero.sh : was script in $AIMSUTILAS, but were wrote in python2, I change it to python3
