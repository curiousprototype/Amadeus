# Details: change 'xrange()' into range() ; change print "" into print (""). 
# Details: add print("" ,end="") in line 89, 93, 95 in order to output band*.out without switchline.


# This script shifts the band structure output by aims (band****.out) so that the highest occupied state coincides with
# the zero of energy.  This is necessary for comparison between different calculations, as the default zero of energy for
# band structures in aims is taken to be the Fermi level, which will differ from calculation to calculation as parameters
# are tweaked.  Even for metals, this will cause noticeable misalignments.
#
# This script runs in the folder containing the band structure, with no parameters needed.  If you provide a number as a
# parameter, it will shift the band structure by that number instead of zeroing out the highest occupied state.
#
# Note this script will not shift the DOS, because I (WPH) have never needed that functionality.  This should be trivial 
# to add in, if you are so inclined.
#
# While this script is provided without warranty, as always in the utility aims folders, this is a slight modification of
# a script that I have used thousands (yes, thousands) of times for a number of different types of band structures.  
# Spin-polarized, non-spin-polarized, spin-orbit-coupled, non-spin-orbit-coupled, insulating, metallic. I'm pretty sure it 
# works.
